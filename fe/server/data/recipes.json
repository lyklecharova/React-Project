          "In a bowl, combine the chia seeds, yogurt, milk, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure that the chia seeds are evenly distributed.",
          "Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 4 hours or overnight. This allows the chia seeds to absorb the liquid and create a pudding-like consistency.",
          "After the chia pudding has set, give it a good stir to break up any clumps. If the pudding is too thick, you can add a bit more milk to reach your desired consistency.",
          "Taste the pudding and adjust the sweetness if needed by adding more honey or maple syrup.",
          "Serve the chia pudding in individual bowls or jars. Top with your favorite fresh fruits, nuts, or granola for added texture and flavor."
